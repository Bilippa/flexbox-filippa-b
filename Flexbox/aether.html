                <h3> Aether, Genshin Impact <br> $58.99 </h3>
                <p> Welcome Aether from Genshin Impact into your collection! <br> Being one of the first announced figurines from
                    our Genshin Impact collection along with his sister Lumine, we are proud to present Aether.
                    Just as all of our figurines, when purchasing Aether you'll recieve multiple face plates that are interchangeable.
                    He also comes with a platform to stand on, along with a set of windglider wings. As usual, this figurine is 
                    interactive and can be posed in various ways as you'd wish.
