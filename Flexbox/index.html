      <p class="intro-p"> Nendoroids are the ultimate figurine for any anime lover out there. Just as any figurine it captures your favorite
      characters and brings them into the 3D world, right before your eyes! Unlike many figurine brands, Nendoroid allows for the 
      figurine to be interactive. When buying one of our figurines you are not only purchasing one solid figure, but with that many faces,
      poses, and extra props depending on character! <br>
      Nendoroids also make for a perfect collectors item, not only are the figurines of high quality but they also come in a box with
      designs designated to the character along with a number for the specific figurine. The box has a frontal window, allowing you to display
      your new figurines without ever having to remove them from the box if you'd prefer that!
