        </h3>
        <p> The founder and creator of this website is Filippa BÃ¶rjesson. The company responsible for the production and business of 
            nendoroids is Good Smile Company. Good Smile is the legitimate seller for Nendoroids, and other types of figurines, however
            they have been incredibly successful leading to many branched out stores and stalls. This website being one of them! We here at
            Nendoroid simply wish to spread the art of figurines!

        <h3>
            Why nendoroids?
        </h3>
        <p> We here at Nendoroid are especially fond of anime and games. We wanted to allow people to bring their favorite
            characters to life through the art of figurines. Nendoroids are unlike many figurines interactive in the sense that
            you as a Nendoroid owner can pose and change the Nendoroid to your liking, almost making it more like a childrens toy
            than a figurine. Nendoroids are also made of quite durable material. The material also makes the colours vibrant and true 
            to that animated feeling.
