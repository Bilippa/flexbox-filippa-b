the viewport, content and initial-scale are to let the browser know how the visuals of the page wil work. How zoomed in it will be when
first loaded (initial-scale=1), what widths it should be based off between devices. Aka makes the page responsive.-->

    <li> The external CSS is not applying to HTML. Suspected reason: stylesheet link is incorrectly placed or the source is incorrect.
        I had only written the source as "style.css" not "css/style.css"! 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> Background color of body tag was not changing to red via background-color: red;. This was because I had written
        ".body" instead of "body" as the tag reference in the stylesheet. The background color was set to red simply to visually
        see if the css was working.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> Currently trying to apply the flexbox that is shown <a href="https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/common-flexbox-patterns/#3x3-grid" id="here">here</a> for the 3x3 grid.
        The margins and padding are applying but not the horisontal placing of the products.
        <br>
        As it turns out the entire .container in css wasn't applying because I had written the class in the flexbox container as "containter"
        instead of container, simply put, this was all because of a spelling mistake. It now works though!
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> The flexbox aspect of the product divs and images within said divs are not going as planned. I've given the images set width and
        height with the pixel unit, this making it unresponsive. I thought this would be ok seeing as they are in divs with flexwrap.
        However, the left and right borders of the divs wrap after reaching the width of the image, meaning they disappear before wrapping.
        I want the entire div to wrap once it's reached a certain margin width outside of the images. 
        <br> I managed to somewhat solve the problem by adding padding (in pixels!! not percentage, percentage makes the
        element relative which seems to cancel out the properties of flexwrap.) to the img element.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> I was testing different flex basis percentages and now the 32% that supposedly should allow 3 items to lay beside each other 
        horizontally no longer shows 3 columns but instead 2. I managed to restore the 3 columns but to do so I had to set flexbasis to 29%
    instead of 32%. I have now figured out (or I believe I have) that this was because the divs that were set to 32% also had padding which
    added to the size of the div hence going outside tthe 32% and triggering the flexwrap. I will be leaving the flexbasis at 28% because 
    that is the width I feel looks the most visually pleasing, and this also allows me to add that padding which makes it look less cramped.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> Having the justify-content attribute set with the space-between value within the main product container did not give me the wanted 
        layout, I mixed it up with space-around. Therefore I have now set it to space-around instead, to make it look nicer when the browser
        is resized.
